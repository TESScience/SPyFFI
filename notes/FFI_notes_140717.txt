John Doty is interested in the frame transfer. Power supply becomes difficult for short frame transfer times. 

Is 50 milliseconds too long for the frame transfer? What are the requirements on streaking? (A few milliseconds up to 50.)

50 ms can be done without terrible difficulty
shorter will require auxiliary power supply


Lateral diffusion of about 3-4 microns. Will depend on depth. Deb’s PSF’s take into account. 

zmax model
million rays
into matlab model, propagate rays through silicon, probabilistic absorption model show depth at which captures, then apply charge diffusion at that depth. (may be refined as more measurements come in from CCDs, bias voltages, etc…)

PSF
charge diffusion
intrapixels sensitivity
RMS motion within exposure
pixelization
PRF


linear filter to describe imperfect electronic effects


right now, Kerri might be able to store 8 images for cosmic algorithms
